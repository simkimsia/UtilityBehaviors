# UtilityBehaviors

## Background

## Requirements

* CakePHP 2.x
* PHP 5.4

## Installation

_[Using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)]_

Add the plugin to your project's `composer.json` - something like this:

```composer
  {
    "require": {
      "simkimsia/utility_behaviors": "dev-master"
    }
  }
```

Because this plugin has the type `cakephp-plugin` set in its own `composer.json`, Composer will install it inside your `/Plugins` directory, rather than in the usual vendors file. It is recommended that you add `/Plugins/UtilityBehaviors` to your .gitignore file. (Why? [read this](http://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md).)

_[Manual]_

* Download this: [http://github.com/simkimsia/UtilityBehaviors/zipball/master](http://github.com/simkimsia/UtilityBehaviors/zipball/master)
* Unzip that download.
* Copy the resulting folder to `app/Plugin`
* Rename the folder you just copied to `UtilityBehaviors`

_[GIT Submodule]_

In your app directory type:

```bash
  git submodule add -b master git://github.com/simkimsia/UtilityBehaviors.git Plugin/UtilityBehaviors
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
```

_[GIT Clone]_

In your `Plugin` directory type:

    git clone -b master git://github.com/simkimsia/UtilityBehaviors.git UtilityBehaviors

### Enable plugin

In 2.0 you need to enable the plugin in your `app/Config/bootstrap.php` file:

    CakePlugin::load('UtilityBehaviors');

If you are already using `CakePlugin::loadAll();`, then this is not necessary.
